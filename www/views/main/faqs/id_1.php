<div>
	<p>For years, life insurance has confused and eluded a large portion of the American population. People either do not know they need coverage, do not know where to start, or get so overwhelmed with the application process that they never secure much needed life insurance coverage.</p>
	<p>We wanted to do everything we could to help Americans get the best life insurance coverage for their families in order to provide for them in the event of their untimely death. As a result, our service was born to help people understand their life insurance options and get the best coverage possible to protect their families.</p>
	<p>These astonishing statistics show many of the reasons we chose to start our no exam life insurance portal:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Only 61% of adults life insurance, a decline from 70% in 1984, and only 41% of adult Americans have life insurance coverage outside of work (the process and time commitment is burdensome).</li>
		<li>Among those with life insurance, about 1 in 5 say that they do not have enough.</li>
		<li>Half of all adults visited a life insurance website and/or sought information online in 2018. Almost 1 in 3 purchased or attempted to purchase life insurance online (If you’ve done this, you are not alone. It was probably too much work and time).</li>
		<li>Most people overestimate the cost of life insurance, especially younger Americans. 44% of Millennials overestimate the cost at 5x the actual amount.</li>
		<li>50% of all people say they are more likely to purchase life insurance if there is no physical examination (sound familiar).</li>
		<li>35% of all households would feel a severe financial impact within 1 month if the primary wage earner died.</li>
		<li>75% of Americans think the greatest benefit that an insurance company can offer is a simplified issue policy.</li>
		<li>There over 600 Companies in the US offering life insurance product (comparing all those companies would take years). Stats taken from LIMRA’s 2018 Insurance Barometer Study.</li>
