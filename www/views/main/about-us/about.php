							“Many people end up getting pressured into buying a more expensive whole life policy from a commissioned agent,” said John Holloway, a licensed life insurance agent and co-founder of digital life insurance brokerage NoExam.com. In truth, term life insurance is what 90% of people actually need.

						<div class="desc">
							An analysis of 80,000 life insurance quotes by Noexam.com revealed that the best time to buy life insurance is in your 30s. Because age and health are two of the most important factors in determining rates, you'll get similar coverage at a lower monthly cost, writes Jonathan Holloway, a life insurance agent and the founder of Noexam.com.

							John Holloway’s insurance brokerage, NoExam.com, was honest with a customer from the get-go: He might not get a life insurance policy because he’d had cancer 10 years earlier.

							Holloway and his business partner, Jonathan Fritz, searched for an insurer they thought would be a good match and helped the customer with the application.

						<div class="date">August 1, 2019</div>
						<div class="desc">
							Another way to save on life insurance is to purchase multiple policies, a practice that is called "laddering." For example, if you need $1 million of coverage at age 30 but only $500,000 at 40 and $200,000 at 50, then buy a 10-year-term $500,000 policy, a 20-year $300,000 policy, and a 30-year term $200,000 policy.
