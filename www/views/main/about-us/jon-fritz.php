					<p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Fritz. I am the founder and CEO of noexam.com.</p>
					<p>I am thrilled you have chosen to visit my website to consider the important value life insurance can have for your
						family. A couple of things I would like you to know about my approach to life insurance.</p>
					<p><strong>I am not beholden to any one life insurance company</strong>. In fact, the life insurance companies you find
						on my website aren&rsquo;t just inclusive to those I partner with. I also cover offerings from companies I compete
						with daily. The reason my overview of life insurance is so comprehensive is simple<strong>, there is no one size
							fits all life insurance company</strong>. It&rsquo;s important that you find the provider and plan that meets
						your needs. Otherwise, you may not end up with life insurance.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>My goal is simple, to provide you with expert non-bias information to help you make an informed decision on your own.
						Whether it means working with you personally or pointing you in the right direction, there is no greater
						accomplishment I can have than helping someone in their journey for life insurance.</p>
					<h2>This is my story</h2>
					<p>After an onset sudden illness that led to an unexpected loss of a family member, <strong>I felt a nudge to dedicate
							my life to helping others understand the world of life insurance</strong>. My career began at Northwestern
						Mutual where I educated my local community on the various forms of life insurance. As my passion evolved I grew to
						be a student of the life insurance industry. During this time, I discovered that the life insurance industry was
						facing a similar challenge that many other industries have faced. That challenge is that consumerism is changing.
					</p>
					<p>Initially, our company entered the market to serve the middle class by offering term life insurance online. In our
						founding years, our team identified the misalignment between the modern consumer and the traditional buying process.
					</p>
					<h3>Our three biggest observations were:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Customers expect quicker gratification when it comes to buying life insurance</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Our customers loved the idea of doing research on their own. </strong>Even more, driving the buying
							process when it comes to their life insurance experience.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Term life insurance is a consumer educated market.</strong> While we have a glossary of resources, term
							life insurance if fairly easy to research and self-educate.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>With that we founded noexam.com as a resource to middle market consumers researching life insurance online.
						What&rsquo;s the difference? We have removed the friction out of the traditional buying process by working with
						insurance companies to offer coverage via accelerated underwriting. This simplifies the buying journey by leveraging
						technology to electronically validate information provided by an applicant throughout the application process.</p>
					<p><strong>Life insurance is a personal decision</strong>, we respect that. My goal is to provide you with the
						information needed to help you make an informed decision. That decision can end up being the biggest one you have
						made for your family. Enjoy the convenience of researching competitively priced life insurance without the hassle.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Jonathan Fritz President and CEO of noexam.com </strong></p>
					<p>There is not a morning, day, or evening I don&rsquo;t think about how to make the life insurance buying process
						easier to navigate for you.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Education (BS): <strong>Finance - Risk Management &amp; Insurance</strong></li>
						<li>Experience: <strong>10 Years of life insurance experience </strong></li>
						<li>Award: <strong>MDRT Top of The Table Recipient (Top 1%) </strong></li>

							Another way to save on life insurance is to purchase multiple policies, a practice that is called "laddering." For example, if you need $1 million of coverage at age 30 but only $500,000 at 40 and $200,000 at 50, then buy a 10-year-term $500,000 policy, a 20-year $300,000 policy, and a 30-year term $200,000 policy.
