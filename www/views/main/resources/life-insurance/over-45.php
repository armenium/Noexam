			<p>We have conversations daily with older consumers looking for <a href="https://www.noexam.com">online life insurance</a>. Their most common concern is about a waiting period. When you buy no exam life insurance plans, they are effective upon approval and payment. That is because your
				eligibility is based on your prescription history and<a href="https://www.mib.com/facts_about_mib.html"> medical information bureau report</a>.</p>
			<h2>Would it be better to take an exam?</h2>
			<p>As you can see above non-med term life insurance is priced affordably. Professionally, I would not suggest for anyone in the senior age range to take an exam.</p>
			<p>For comparison sake, here are a few preferred rates with an exam for a male age 55 $250k non smoker.</p>

			<p>Before you take an exam be aware of the <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/approval-time/">approval process</a> and a potential rate increase.</p>
			<h2>With an Exam</h2>
			<p>If you decide that taking an exam is the direction you would like to go, here is what you need to know:</p>
			<p>Typically the review time frame will run 30-60 days. The insurance company will look through your medical files from the doctors you have visited in the past 5-10 years. The final price is calculated after taking into consideration your lab results and records. If needles or doctor&#8217;s
				visits make you uncomfortable, then an exam can make your rate higher. Here is an article covering what life insurance companies look for in a health exam.</p>
			<p>Most of the time after the company reviews your medical records, it can set the stage for additional questions. Now, if you are a senior that has not kept up with routine doctor visits, this will likely cause the company not to offer you a policy.</p>
			<p>Both exam and no exam options will base their offers on your age, build, tobacco use, family history and medications. The no exam plans are simplified and do not require as much detail in turn making the process easier on you to apply for coverage.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The best thing you can do to get coverage is to work with a licensed agent who has experience with this type of life insurance.</p>
			<p>At noexam.com, we have a seasoned team of life insurance professionals ready to help you review the best life insurance options for seniors. That is if you are inclined to call yourself a senior!</p>
			<p>There&#8217;s no shame in getting older. In fact, it is a perfect time to organize your life insurance plans. You can get started with your policy today by heading over to<a href="https://www.noexam.com/apply-now/"> noexam.com/apply-now</a>.</p>
