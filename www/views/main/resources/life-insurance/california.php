			<p>Our mission at NoExam.com is to provide you with no nonsense information on life insurance. We have put together this resource for life insurance companies in California. </p>

			<p>It’s important to mention that a life insurance company does not have to be within the state of California to sell their products to California residents.</p>

			<p>Many of the companies on this list are headquartered outside of California. According to the California insurance department, there are only four companies that are based in California! </p>

			<p>Our recommendation is to choose a company based on financial strength and product offering. The last thing you want is a life insurance policy from an inferior provider.</p>

			<h2>Look Up An Agent’s License in California</h2>

			<p>If you are working with a life insurance agent in California, it is a good idea to look up their license. You can do so by <a href="https://interactive.web.insurance.ca.gov/webuser/licw_name_search$.startup">visiting this url</a> and searching for their name. It will tell you if that agent has a valid California insurance license.</p>

			<p>Check to see that their license is in good standing with the CA department of insurance. You can also see what companies the agent is contracted to sell with. You will want an agent that has access to many different life insurance companies in California.</p>

			<h2>California Unclaimed Life Insurance Benefits Look Up</h2>

			<p>In 2008, the state of California began auditing life insurance companies practices. The result was the discovery that life many companies were not paying claims. In short, beneficiaries did not know that they were owed any life insurance payouts. To combat this, the controller's officer released a tool that consumers can use to search for unclaimed life insurance in California. To conduct a search, <a href="https://ucpi.sco.ca.gov/UCP/LifeInsuranceSearch.aspx">use this link</a>.</p>

			<h2>Choosing the Right Insurance Coverage</h2>

			<p>We recommend term life insurance for most of our customers. This is because it offers the most value. It provides a death benefit for your loved ones for a low, fixed monthly rate. It does not have any investment component and cash value buildup.</p>
