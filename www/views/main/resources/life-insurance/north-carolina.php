			<p>We have gathered the important information for people who are looking to buy life insurance policy in North Carolina. Let us help you out by providing you the key information, so that you do not have to spend hours researching different <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/">life insurance companies</a>.</p>

			<h2>Considerations When Shopping for Life Insurance in North Carolina</h2>

			<p>There are several considerations NC residents need to keep in mind while shopping for life insurance.</p>

			<p>The foremost question is whether you are looking for whole life policy or term life policy. In both the cases, the life insurance premium will be determined by several factors such as your age, health, job, life style and other such things.</p>

			<p>Life insurance premiums in North Carolina are generally higher for older people as well as for smokers and people with a history of health complications. NoExam.com ensures that you get to compare life insurance quotes from the best companies offering coverage to people in North Carolina.</p>

			<h2>North Carolina Term Life Insurance Quotes </h2>

			<p>Here is an example quote for a 39 years old woman living in Charlotte, NC. Provided that the woman is 5’3” tall and weighs 119 pounds, she may have to pay $522 in annual premium for obtaining a $1,000,000 20 year term life policy.</p>

			<h2>North Carolina Whole Life Insurance Quotes</h2>

			<p>If the above mentioned woman is looking to buy $1,000,000 whole life policy then she will have to pay nearly 10x the annual premium. For this quote, it is assumed that she does not have adverse medical history and does not smoke.</p>

			<h2>North Carolina Life Insurance Regulations</h2>

			<p>Chapter 58 of the state statutes governs the operations of life insurance companies in North Carolina. The statute enumerates various rights of the life insurance policy holders. It also governs the best practices for the insurance industry to be followed.</p>

			<h2>Free Look Period in North Carolina</h2>

			<p>North Carolina provides 10 days free look period. During this period, the holder may check out its various features and may decide to return the policy to receive the full refund. </p>

			<h2>Grace Period</h2>

			<p>The minimum grace period allowed in North Carolina is 30 days while many insurance companies provide longer grace period out of their own accord. </p>

			<p>The grace period begins from the day missed premium payment becomes due. The policy remains active during this time period and does not lapse. Further, the holder remains fully covered in case of death during the grace period.</p>

			<p>Grace period helps both the insured and insurance company as it removes the requirement of new underwriting in the cases of slight delay in payment of policy premium. New underwriting is required when a new policy is issue or a lapsed policy has to be reinstated.</p>

			<h2>Guarantee of Payments and Cash Surrender Value in North Carolina</h2>

			<p>North Carolina endeavors to protect the insurance policy holders in the state through the North Carolina Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association.</p>
