			<h2>How much does life insurance cost?</h2>
			<p>The price of life insurance varies greatly from person to person. A 20-year term policy with a $100,000 death benefit will cost a 30-year-old male in good health around $12 per month. The same policy will cost a 60-year-old male around $65 per month. The rate calculator tool below
				allows you to quickly compare custom quotes with accurate pricing.</p>

			<h2 id="financial">Financial Strength</h2>
			<h3>Financial Ratings Explained</h3>
			<p>Financial strength is the most important factor we considered when ranking life insurance companies. It is the very factor that determines the validity of your contract with an insurance company. Think of it this way—life insurance is meant to be a financial safety net for your
				family. The net, however, is only as strong as the insurance company’s ability to honor its claims.</p>
			<h3>The Importance of Financial Stability</h3>
			<p>Insurance companies increase their profits by investing a portion of the money they receive from the policyholders in the market. </p>
			<p>The market, by its very nature, is unpredictable and could go up or down depending on various factors. When it does go down, a company could suffer losses, albeit only in the short term.</p>
			<p>During such times, unless the company is financially stable and has sufficient statutory reserves, it might struggle to continue its operations, settle claims, and pay for surrendered policies. This is why the financial rating of a company matters a lot.</p>
			<p>Similarly, if there is a catastrophic event or there is a sudden drop in the market, people might panic and want to surrender their policies or withdraw money from their policies. Such a sudden spike in surrender and withdrawal requests can only be handled by companies that have
				significant financial resources at their disposal.</p>
			<h3>Financial Rating by Independent Agencies</h3>
			<p>Independent agencies like <a href="http://www.ambest.com/home/default.aspx">AM Best</a>, <a href="https://www.moodys.com/">Moody’s</a>, <a href="https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/home">Standard & Poor’s</a>, <a
						href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/ratings/study/U.S.-Life-Insurance-Study/5030ENG">J.D. Power</a> and <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/site/insurance">Fitch</a> rate insurance companies according to their financial stability.</p>
			<p>These agencies analyze a company’s financial data. Data like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The amount collected in premiums</li>
				<li>The amount paid out in claims</li>
				<li>Statutory reserves and assets</li>
				<li>Cash flow</li>
				<li>Return on investments</li>
				<li>Potential risks in the short-term and the long-term</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If a life insurance company is rated highly by these agencies on a consistent basis, it is a very good sign of its ability to honor its commitments. If a company receives subpar ratings from these agencies, you should be wary of choosing it.</p>
			<h2>Best Life Insurance Companies by Financial Rating</h2>

			<?php if($isMobile):?>
				<div class="ajaxContent" data-view-file="/main/widgets/company-ratings-table.php"></div>
			<?php else:?>
				<?=$this->render('/main/widgets/company-ratings-table.php');?>

			<h2>Life Insurance Companies With the Most Assets</h2>
			<?=Yii::$app->Helpers->getImage(['src' => '/img/life-insurance-companies.png', 'alt' => 'life insurance companies asset chart', 'from_cdn' => true, 'lazyload' => true]);?>
			<h2 id="products">Product Offering</h2>
			<p>When ranking the companies, we look for insurance organizations that offer a wide range of policies. Everyone’s financial situation is different and having a selection of life insurance products is the best way to find the right solution. Here are some recommendations on the
				different products offered.</p>
			<h3>Convertible Policies</h3>
			<p>Look for a company that allows you to convert a term policy into a permanent one. A <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/">term life insurance</a> plan generally lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 years.</p>
			<p>If you are in your 50’s or 60’s when it expires, you might need to get yourself insured again. Qualifying for a new policy at that age can be difficult. You might be charged higher
				<a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/rates/">life insurance rates</a> compared to younger applicants.</p>
			<p>With the conversion option, you can convert your existing term policy into a permanent one. No need to qualify for a new policy or undergo any medical tests. Even if you think that you might not need it, it’s a good option to have.</p>
			<h3>Policy Riders and Additional Benefits</h3>
			<p>Look for a company that offers optional policy riders and benefits. A <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/cheap/">standard term policy is the cheapest option</a> you could go for, but it may not cover all your needs.</p>
			<p>What happens if you develop a terminal illness or a disability? This could prevent you from working and also cause significant medical expenses.</p>
			<p>In such a scenario, a pure term policy is of little use. Your family can receive the payout only after your passing. In the meantime, you have to dig into your savings to pay for your treatment costs. This can leave your family vulnerable in the short term. An accelerated death
				benefit rider can be extremely beneficial to your family in such cases.</p>
			<p>The accelerated death benefit rider gives you the option of receiving a portion of your death benefit while you are still alive. You can use the money to pay for your treatment without having to deplete your savings or borrow money.</p>
			<p>Similarly, there are other policy riders available for different scenarios:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>accidental death</li>
				<li>disability</li>
				<li>critical illness</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/waiver-of-premium/">waiver of premium</a></li>
				<li>unemployment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Choosing one or more of these riders will increase your premium payments. However, paying a few dollars more is worth the extra protection these riders provide.</p>
			<h2 id="complaints">Life Insurance Company Complaints and Customer Reviews</h2>
			<p>You should check the company’s complaints in regard to settling its claims. Does it have a long record of serving its customers well? Has it settled all or most of its claims without any issues? These are the questions you need to ask to find out if the company is the right choice for
				you.</p>
			<p>Does the company have a history of policy cancellations and claim disputes? Think twice before choosing a company that does, even if its rates happen to be affordable.</p>
			<p>There is no point in choosing a low-cost policy if the company has a history of resisting claims.</p>
			<p><strong>Remember!</strong> Your loved ones have to file a claim with the insurance company after your death to receive the payout. The last thing they need is for the company to make them jump through hoops to receive the payout. So, choosing a company known for its positive
				track record is crucial.</p>
			<p>You can check a company’s track record with the BBB and the NAIC. Also, check with your state’s insurance department for any complaints.</p>
			<h2 id="underwriting">Life Insurance Company Underwriting Policies</h2>
			<p>When comparing companies, we consider each company’s underwriting guidelines. Some companies have strict guidelines. For example, you are likely to qualify for the cheapest rates only if you are young and in excellent health.</p>
			<p>If you have any health risk factors, you are likely to qualify for the more expensive rates. Risk factors include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you are overweight</li>
				<li>If you have a family history of heart disease, cancer and other health conditions</li>
				<li>If you have a high-risk occupation or are a participant in extreme sports or hobbies</li>
				<li>If you smoke</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other companies can be more lenient with their underwriting guidelines.</p>
			<p>Even if you do not qualify for the cheap rates with one company, you might be able to do so with another company. By doing so, you might be able to save hundreds of dollars in life insurance premiums every year.</p>
			<p>This is why it is important to get quotes from multiple companies while buying life insurance. Not all companies have the same guidelines or medical test requirements. So, choose one where you are most likely to qualify for the lowest possible rates.</p>

			<h2 id="prices">Life Insurance Company Prices</h2>
			<p>Pricing is often the most important factor when shopping for life insurance. Because of this, we analyzed pricing for all of the companies we consider in our ranking. All 10 companies in our top 10 rankings have competitive pricing. </p>
			<h3>What life insurance company has the lowest rates?</h3>
			<p>The answer to this depends on your overall health, coverage amount, and term length. It is difficult to say who has the best rates when the factors and conditions vary so much. One company might have better rates for older customers, where another may be the best choice for someone
				with asthma. Thus, the company with the cheapest rates for you depends on your unique situation and policy needs. Your best bet is to shop multiple companies and compare rates. </p>
			<h3>What does life insurance cost monthly?</h3>
			<p>For a term life insurance policy from one of the more well-known companies, you can expect to pay between $20 per month and $75 per month. This will depend on your age, coverage amount, term length, and overall health. See more on the <a
						href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/average-cost/">average cost of life insurance</a>.</p>
			<p>Here is a chart displaying the average cost of life insurance as you get older. This was done in our life insurance pricing study which analyzed over 100,000 life insurance quotes. </p>
			<?=Yii::$app->Helpers->getImage(['class' => 'img-fluid', 'src' => '/img/life-insurance-prices.png', 'alt' => 'life insurance average prices', 'from_cdn' => true, 'lazyload' => true]);?>

			<h2 id="mutual">Traditional Insurance Companies vs. Mutual Insurance Companies</h2>
			<p>If you are looking to buy a permanent life policy, it is advisable to buy it from a mutual insurance company, rather than a traditional insurance company.</p>
			<p>The difference between a traditional life insurance company and a mutual life insurance company is that the former is owned by stockholders whereas the latter is owned by the policyholders themselves.</p>
			<p>This is why mutual insurance companies tend to distribute their surplus revenue evenly among their policyholders in the form of dividends.</p>
			<p>If your insurance provider pays dividends every year, it could be an additional source of income for you throughout the term of the policy. This is above and beyond what you receive in terms of the cash component and the death benefit.</p>
			<p>While this certainly should not be a make-or-break factor in deciding which company you should do business with, it can be an additional criterion based on which you can compare different insurance companies.</p>

			<h2 id="avoid">Companies to Avoid</h2>
			<p>The majority of insurance providers in the US are financially stable and committed to serving their customers. However, there are some companies that are notorious for denying and delaying claims and are rated poorly by customers and rating agencies alike.</p>
			<p>Based on their track record, it is not advisable for you to trust them with your hard-earned money. Let us take a look at them now.</p>
