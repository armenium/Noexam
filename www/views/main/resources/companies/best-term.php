				<h2>Term Life Insurance Companies – The Options Available for You</h2>
				<p>There are nearly 800 <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/">life insurance companies</a> in the US today, which means there are an extraordinarily wide range of <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/best-policies/">term life policies</a> available for you to choose from.</p>
				<p>You should, at the same time, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all term life policy that can meet everyone’s needs. What suits your needs might not suit someone else’s, what is affordable for you might be too expensive for someone else, and so on.</p>
				<p>The same rule applies to term life insurance companies as well. Each company has its own underwriting policy and has a different definition of what they consider a ‘preferred customer’.</p>
				<p>There are companies that charge exorbitant rates for smokers and then there are companies that offer affordably priced policies for them. Similarly, there are companies that primarily cater to a young customer base and then there are other companies that cater to older people.</p>
				<p>For example, companies like State Farm and AARP offer competitively priced policies for seniors.</p>
				<p>AIG is known for offering low-cost policies for young people, MetLife is known for its lenient underwriting guidelines for people suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, Haven Life is known for its ‘no medical exam’ policies, and Banner is known for offering reasonably priced policies for smokers.</p>
				<p>So, the best term life insurance company is one which caters to your specific needs and offers policies that you can afford to buy.</p>
				<h2>How to Choose the Right Term Life Insurance Company?</h2>
				<p>With so many options to choose from, you might find it hard to find the right term life insurance company, unless you know exactly what to look for.</p>
				<p>Given here is a list of five key factors that you need to consider while choosing a term life insurance company.</p>
				<h2>Financial Strength</h2>
				<p>Financial strength is the single biggest factor which determines the reliability of an insurance provider. So, no matter what type of policy you need, you should make sure you buy it from a financially strong and stable company.</p>
				<p>Agencies like AM Best, Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and Fitch rate insurance companies based on their long-term financial stability. You can check out these ratings to find out if a particular company is trustworthy or not.</p>
				<h2>Policies Offered</h2>
				<p>An ideal term life insurance company is one which offers you a policy that is competitively priced and covers your financial needs adequately. It should also offer riders, using which you can boost your coverage, provide additional protection to yourself as well as your family, and make contingency plans for what-if scenarios.</p>
				<h2>Convertibility</h2>
				<p>A term life policy, by its very nature, is meant to cover your financial needs for a limited period of time. It could be 10, 15, 20, or 30 years, but it will expire at the end of the term period. If your policy has a convertibility option, you can convert it into a permanent life policy after the initial term period.</p>
				<p>If you do not have any family members who are financially dependent on you or if you have a passive income source that covers all your financial needs adequately, you might not have to extend your coverage at the end of the initial term period. Still, life might throw a curveball at you any time, so it is a nice option to have.</p>
				<h2>Affordable Premium</h2>
				<p>The premium for a term life policy usually differs from one company to another, since each company has its own terms and conditions and underwriting guidelines.</p>
				<p>Moreover, it is important for you to choose a term life insurance company based on your insurability. If you smoke, play extreme sports, serve in the military, use marijuana, have high blood pressure or diabetes, or have DUI convictions in your record, you cannot afford to buy a term life policy randomly from any company you want.</p>
				<p>If the company has strict underwriting policies or views your marijuana usage, extreme hobbies, or DUI convictions unfavorably, you might end up paying through the nose for your policy.</p>
				<p>So, you should contact different companies, get customized quotes, compare them carefully, and choose a company that offers a policy which is suited for your needs and budget.</p>
				<h2>Customer Service</h2>
				<p>Is the company easy to deal with? Do they respond to your calls and emails quickly? Do they take your complaints seriously? Do they have a dedicated customer service team that you contact any time?</p>
				<p>These are questions you need to ask before zeroing in on a term life insurance company. If the company’s customer service does not meet your expectations, avoid it by all means and look for a better alternative. Or else, your family might have a hard time filing a claim and receiving a payout after your death.</p>
				<h2>How Much Coverage Do You Need?</h2>
				<p>The easiest way to determine the amount of coverage you need on your term policy is to apply the DIME formula.</p>
				<p>DIME stands for debt, income, mortgage, and education, which are the four key factors you need to consider while calculating the life insurance coverage you need.</p>
				<p>You need to add the total amount of debts you have, five or ten years of your annual income, your mortgage, and your children’s tuition expenses. The resulting amount is what your family might need to take care of their financial needs in your absence.</p>
				<p>Another option is to multiply your annual income by 10, add $100,000 for each of your children’s education, and add any debts you have to arrive at a figure.</p>
				<p>If you are in your 60’s or 70’s, you need to add an estimate of your final expenses to the calculation. A funeral can cost up to $15,000 and in the absence of a sufficient insurance payout, your family might be forced to dip into their savings accounts to meet the expenses.</p>
