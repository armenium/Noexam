			<p>Ladder Life is a digital insurance provider based in California. The company offers fully underwritten term life policies which provide substantial coverage at very reasonable rates.</p>

			<p>This Ladder Life review exhibits the company’s innovative approach to life insurance, its uniquely designed term life policy, and the pros and cons of choosing Ladder life insurance to protect loved ones.</p>

			<h2 id="ourtake">Our Take</h2>
			<blockquote class="blue">Ladder is a very good choice for those who are young, healthy, and in need of a term life policy. Individuals in their 50s or 60s and with pre-existing conditions will likely get better coverage from another company. There are other companies that do not have entry barriers for these age groups and health categories, and they have more lenient underwriting guidelines as well.</blockquote>

			<h2 id="about">About Ladder</h2>

			<p>Established in 2017, <strong>Ladder is one of the newest entrants to the US insurance market</strong>. The company’s tech savvy approach makes it extremely easier to buy life insurance coverage, as the whole process can be completed online.</p>

			<p>Ladder’s instant <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/approval-time/">approval process</a> has made the company gain popularity rather quickly. In fact, within the first 100 days of its inception, the company <a href="https://medium.com/ladderlife/life-its-changing-15857a5f48f7">managed to issue life insurance policies worth $100 million</a>.</p>

			<p>Data from LIMRA shows there is a $16 trillion gap between the amount of coverage needed for the US population and the existing amount of coverage purchased. Ladder’s founders want to bridge that gap, and they recently <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90202099/exclusive-sofi-teams-up-with-ladder-to-offer-revamped-life-insurance">partnered with SoFi to help bring life insurance to their over 500,000 members</a>.</p>

			<p>Ladder aims to do its part in closing the gap by offering competitive rates, making it easier to buy, and offering an easily customizable product. Ladder Life Insurance is backed by two major players in the insurance industry, Fidelity Security Life Insurance Company and Hannover Re, making the company a powerhouse in the competitive life insurance industry.</p>

			<h2 id="ratings">Financial Strength</h2>

			<p>With Ladder’s policies underwritten and issued by Fidelity Security Life and reinsured by Hannover Re, the financial security of these two companies becomes imperative in reviewing Ladder. Below are these companies’ ratings.</p>

			<h3>Fidelity Security Life</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A.M. Best: A (Excellent)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Hannover Re</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A.M. Best: A+</li>

				<li>Standard & Poor’s: AA–</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are excellent ratings, which indicate both the insurer and the reinsurer are financially stable and can meet their commitments to all their customers.</p>

			<p>The next question brings into light the term policies offered by Ladder Life Insurance.</p>

			<h2 id="products">Term Life Insurance by Ladder</h2>

			<p>Ladder offers a <strong>dynamic term life insurance</strong> policy which is different from most other <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/">term life</a> policies on the market today./p>

				<strong>The key features include:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Five different term lengths to choose from: 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years.</li>
				<li>At the end of the term policy holders have the option to renew the policy on a yearly basis for up to five years.</li>
				<li>It is a level premium policy which comes with a price-lock guarantee. All policies maintain first-month premiums through the last month of the policy.</li>
				<li>The face value of a Ladder policy could be anywhere from $100,000 to $8 million.</li>
				<li>It is a dynamic policy, which means <strong>coverage amount can increase or decrease any time</strong> as the policy holder’s financial needs change.</li>
				<li>Ladder life insurance is available to US citizens or permanent residents between the ages of 20 and 60.</li>
				<li>There is a 30-day “free look” period, during which newly insured policy holders can cancel the policy and get a full refund from the company.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="application">The Application Process</h2>

			<p>First, applicants should decide how much life insurance they need. <a href="https://www.noexam.com/out/ladder.php">Ladder Life Insurance’s website</a> has a calculator which allows applicants to determine the coverage amount they need in an accurate manner. Once the applicant decides on a number, he or she receives a life insurance quote, and the application process can begin.</p>

			<p>The online form requires applicants to answer several questions related to personal health condition, occupation, and lifestyle. Based on the answers they provide, there are three possible outcomes of this preliminary questionnaire. Below is a rundown of these three outcomes. </p>

			<h2>Applicant Is Approved</h2>

			<p>Applicants who are young and healthy are likely to get qualified instantly. There is no need for a medical exam or even a phone interview. In this scenario, applicants can get the coverage they need within minutes.</p>

			<h2>Applicant Must Undergo a Medical Exam</h2>

			<p>If there are any pre-existing conditions or if there are any anomalies in health data, a medical exam might be necessary.</p>

			<p>Medical exams are administered at the applicant’s home or office, whichever is convenient. The company will send a technician to the location and time of the applicant’s choosing.</p>

			<p>The technician will measure height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure, ask several questions about health conditions, and collect blood and urine samples. Once the company receives the test results, they later notify applicants of their approved or declined answer. </p>

			<h2>Applicant Is Declined</h2>

			<p>If the applicant has several pre-existing conditions, has a family history of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and/or other such major illnesses, and/or leads an unhealthy lifestyle, he or she is likely to get declined.</p>

			<h2>The Underwriting Process</h2>

			<p>Ladder uses intricately designed algorithms to underwrite life insurance policies <a href="https://medium.com/ladderlife/heres-what-instant-life-insurance-really-looks-like-b86ae8f1d4f">in as little as 429 milliseconds</a>. These algorithms can analyze large volumes of data in real time and determine the insurability of individuals who apply for a policy.</p>

			<p>As a result, applicants are aware of their status (approval, undergo a medical exam, or declined) in a matter minutes after applying online.</p>

			<p>This close-to-instant decision is an unprecedented development in the life insurance industry. The traditional application process involves talking to an agent, comparing <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term-vs-whole/">different types of policies</a>, filling out pages and pages of forms, going through a phone interview, and undergoing a medical exam.</p>

			<p>After doing all these things, the applicant still must wait for weeks to hear from the insurance company.</p>

			<blockquote class="green">With Ladder Life Insurance, on the other hand, the whole process can be finished within minutes. The application process itself takes only about five minutes.</blockquote>

			<p>Once the applicant answers all the questions, the algorithms analyze the personal and medical information in a lightning fast manner and instantly notify the applicant of approval status. If approved, the online system grants life insurance coverage instantly.</p>

			<p>Below are some pros and cons of choosing Ladder as an insurance provider.</p>

			<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

			<h3>Online Application Process</h3>

			<p>Ladder Life Insurance’s application process can be completed online, and <strong>approval is possible within minutes</strong>. Anyone who has ever applied for a policy with a traditional life insurance provider can attest to just how incredible this is. Instead of waiting for weeks, results are received in under 10 minutes.</p>

			<h3>No Upselling</h3>

			<p>Many insurance companies use commissioned agents to sell their policies. The commission for a permanent life policy is typically higher compared to a term life policy. Thus, they invariably employ the upselling strategy—convincing the customer to buy a whole life policy even if he or she only needs coverage for a specific time period. As a result, customers end up paying more for coverage they do not even need.</p>

			<p>Ladder Life Insurance, on the other hand, does not use commissioned agents to sell its policies. The company only employs licensed insurance professionals who are paid a monthly salary. Therefore, life insurance applicants can be sure these representatives have their best interests at heart in making policy recommendations.</p>

			<h3>No Exam Policy</h3>

			<p>Ladder Life Insurance allows qualified individuals to buy <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/no-exam/">life insurance coverage without undergoing medical exams</a>. Young, healthy individuals without a family history of serious diseases and disorders and who do not have any high-risk hobbies are likely to get approved instantly.</p>

			<p>The best part is Ladder offers as much as $8 million in coverage for qualified individuals. While there are insurance companies which allow applicants to buy life insurance coverage without going through any exams, the coverage amount is usually capped at $1 million.</p>

			<p>With Ladder, approved users can buy an $8 million term life policy without a phone interview, in-person interview, or medical exam, which is unprecedented in the industry.</p>

			<h3>Simple and Uncomplicated Product</h3>

			<p>One of the many advantages of a pure term life policy, like the one offered by Ladder, is that it allows the insured to safeguard financial interests when they need it the most.</p>

			<p>Individuals in their 30s who do not have any health problems can get a substantial amount of <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/cheap/">coverage at very cheap rates</a>. A 30-year, $1-million-term life policy is likely to cost around $60 a month.</p>

			<p>These insurance rates average <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term-vs-whole/">three to 10 times cheaper than that of a whole life policy</a>. What is even better is the premium does not increase for any reason.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic Term Life Policy</h3>

			<p><strong>This is one of the biggest advantages of buying a policy from Ladder</strong>. Unlike most other insurance companies, Ladder does not offer a level death benefit policy. Instead, it offers a dynamic term life policy, which allows the insured to ladder up (increase the death benefit) or ladder down (decrease the death benefit) any time. Thus, this is a policy that can adjust depending on the insured’s life insurance needs.</p>

			<p>This policy would work well for a recently married 30-year-old man who lives in a one-bedroom apartment with his wife. Instead of buying a 30-year, $1 million policy which covers all the current and future financial obligations, he can buy a 30-year, $250,000 policy which is enough to replace his income for a particular period of time in the event of his death. </p>

			<p>After the birth of his first child, he can add $200,000 to the coverage for 20 years. After moving into a larger home, he can add another $500,000 to his coverage for 20 years, which should be sufficient <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/mortgage/">life insurance to pay off his mortgage</a>.</p>

			<p>Similarly, as his financial obligations reduce over time, he can ladder down his coverage. When he pays off his mortgage, when his children go off to college, or when he moves into a smaller home, he can reduce his coverage amount accordingly.</p>

			<p>This is an excellent strategy which can save him thousands of dollars over time.</p>

			<h3>Free Look Period</h3>

			<p>Ladder Life Insurance has a 30-day free look period during which the policy holder can cancel the policy for any reason and get his or her money back.</p>

			<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

			<h3>Strict Eligibility Criteria</h3>

			<p>Applicants must be between the ages of 20 and 60 in order to apply for a policy with Ladder Life Insurance. This is quite a narrow range, especially when considering there are companies that offer term life policies for people aged 75 and older.</p>

			<p>Moreover, Ladder also has a rule that the insured’s current age and the policy’s term length, when added together, should not exceed 70 years. For instance, if an individual is 50, he cannot apply for a 30-year policy, as the total (50+30 = 80) exceeds 70.</p>

			<p>In the table given below are the term lengths available based on eligibility of age.</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Age</th>
					<th>Maximum Term Length</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>60</td>
					<td>10 Year</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>55</td>
					<td>15 Year</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>50</td>
					<td>20 Year</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>45</td>
					<td>25 Year</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>40</td>
					<td>30 Year</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>This rule further restricts an already narrow range of age. Thus, Ladder Life Insurance is not the right choice for everyone. </p>

			<h3>No Riders</h3>

			<p>Ladder does not offer any riders with its term life policy, which is a big downside. Competitors such as Haven Life and Ethos both offer policy riders.</p>

			<h3>No Permanent Life Policies</h3>

			<p>Ladder, as mentioned above, only offers term life policies. It is not the right choice for those who are need a <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/whole/">whole life</a> or universal life policy. Those needing lifelong coverage should consult NoExam.com’s list of the <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/whole/best-companies/">best whole life insurance companies</a>.</p>
