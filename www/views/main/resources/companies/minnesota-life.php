			<p>Minnesota Life Insurance, now known as Securian, is one of the oldest, most established names in the insurance industry. The company offers a wide array of life insurance policies, accident and illness insurance policies, as well as annuity products.</p>

			<p>In this review, we discuss Minnesota Life (Securian Financial Group), its history and background, financial strength, the range of products it offers, and its strengths and weaknesses.</p>

			<h2 id="ourtake">Our Take</h2>
			<blockquote class="green">Minnesota Life Insurance exceeds expectations in terms of financial ratings. The company offers affordably priced term life plans as well as permanent life plans with excellent benefits. They are a good choice for life insurance overall, though they did not make our <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/">top 10 best life insurance companies</a> list.</blockquote>
			<?=$this->render('/main/widgets/apply-now-form.php', ['position' => 'center', 'width' => '100%']);?>
			<h2 id="about">History</h2>

			<p>Minnesota Life’s history can be traced back to 1880, when Russell Dorr – the company’s founder – set up the Bankers Association of Minnesota. It was the <a href="https://www.securian.com/about-us/our-company/our-history.html">very first life insurance company to operate out of Minnesota</a>. It is currently based in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>

			<p><strong>In 1901</strong>, the company underwent a structural transformation and became a mutual life insurance company under a new name – Minnesota Mutual Life. From then on, the company has managed to grow from strength to strength and has become one of the largest providers of insurance products in the country.</p>

			<p><strong>In 2018</strong>, Minnesota Mutual Life adopted the name of its parent company – Securian Financial Group, Inc. Today, it operates as a fully-owned subsidiary of Securian under the same name.</p>

			<h2 id="ratings">Minnesota Life Financial Ratings</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A.M. Best: A+ (Superior)</li>

				<li>Moody’s: Aa3 (Excellent)</li>

				<li>Standard & Poor’s: AA– (Very Strong)</li>

				<li>Fitch: AA (Very Strong)</li>

				<li>Comdex: 95</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.securian.com/about-us/ratings/am-best-ratings-detail.html">Source of Ratings</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>As you can see, Minnesota Life is rated very highly by all the major ratings agencies, which is a result of its consistent performance and the capacity to meet its financial obligations to its policyholders.</p>

			<p>Minnesota Life is a Fortune 500 company with <a href="https://www.securian.com/about-us/our-company.html">assets worth $78.6 billion under its management</a>. It has close to 19 million customers in North America alone and has issued policies worth $1.2 trillion. In 2018, the company nearly $5.7 billion in statutory benefits to its policyholders.</p>

			<p>Minnesota Life has all the hallmarks of a financially stable and reliable company – in terms of market share, earnings, value of insurance in force, and assets under management.</p>

			<h2>Other Options to Consider</h2>
			<?=$this->render('/main/widgets/vs-page-companies.php'); //Top Three Companies Embed Code?>

			<h2 id="products">Life Insurance Products Offered by Minnesota Life</h2>

			<h3>Term Life Insurance</h3>

			<p>Minnesota Life offers a traditional <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/">term life insurance</a> policy which offers you guaranteed protection for a certain period of time. If you pass away while your policy is in force, the beneficiary designated by you will receive the death benefit amount.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The policy’s term length could be 5, 10, 20, or 30 years. You can decide how many years of coverage you need and then choose an appropriate term length.</li>
				<li>In the event of your death, the entire death benefit amount is paid out to your designated beneficiary. The best part is that your loved ones do not have to pay any taxes on it.</li>
				<li>Like most other insurance providers, Minnesota Life too offers you the choice to change your term plan into a permanent plan at the end of the initial coverage period.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The convertibility option can be particularly beneficial to people from low-income households. If you are a young man or a woman in an entry-level position, a term life policy is probably the best choice for you, since you can get a substantial amount of coverage at extremely low costs.</p>

			<p>As you reach your prime earning years, you can get your term policy converted into a permanent policy, which costs more and provides you with lifelong coverage.</p>

			<h3>Whole Life Insurance</h3>

			<p>Minnesota Life offers a traditional <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/whole/">whole life</a> policy which offers guaranteed protection for a lifetime. You are assured of coverage as long as you pay the premium. You lose coverage only if you stop making payments and let your policy lapse.</p>

			<p>The policy includes an account which accumulates cash value at a fixed rate. The rate of interest is set by the insurer while the policy goes into effect and remains consistent throughout the coverage period. It is intended to offer you living benefits – financial benefits that you can use while you are still alive.</p>

			<p>You can use the cash value account like an emergency fund. You can get a loan whenever you need money and pay it back with interest. The rate of interest charged by the insurance company is generally lower than what you pay for a bank loan.</p>

			<p>If you happen to pass away without repaying the loan, the insurance company will deduct the outstanding amount (principal and interest along with late fees or penalties, if applicable) from your policy’s death benefit. The remaining amount will be paid out to your family.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest upsides of a whole life policy is that the premium remains consistent throughout the coverage period. Your monthly or yearly contribution to your policy remains unchanged until your death.</p>

			<h3>Universal Life Insurance</h3>

			<p>Minnesota Life’s universal life policy offers you the amount of coverage you need for a lifetime. The key features include</p>

			<p><strong>Lifelong Protection</strong> – You are covered until the day of your death, as long as you meet the minimum required contributions to your policy.</p>

			<p><strong>Flexible Premium</strong> – You can pay more if you get an unexpected salary bump or bonus and pay less when money is tight. Or you can pay a fixed, consistent amount on a monthly or yearly basis. It is up to you to decide how much you pay – as long as you stay within the limits set by the insurer.</p>

			<p><strong>Flexible Death Benefit</strong> – You can increase or decrease your policy’s death benefit depending on your needs. For instance, you can increase your coverage amount when you have major <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/mortgage/">financial commitments like mortgage</a> and children’s education. You can decrease it when you pay off the mortgage or when your children go off to college.</p>

			<p><strong>Living Benefits</strong> – You can access the money in your policy’s cash value account to pay for your policy or for emergency purposes.</p>

			<p>Minnesota Life offers three different types of universal life policies – fixed universal life, indexed universal life, and variable universal life.</p>

			<h4>Fixed Universal Life Policy</h4>

			<p>True to its name, the policy is designed to accumulate cash value at a fixed rate. The rate of interest paid by the insurer is determined based on a variety of different factors. Once set, the interest rate does not decrease for the entirety of the policy’s term.</p>

			<h4>Indexed Universal Life Policy </h4>

			<p>In this policy, the cash value account is tied to an index. So, the accumulation of cash value is entirely dependent on the performance of the index.</p>

			<p>Since index funds are known to perform better than most other types of investments, you can definitely expect to get higher returns from an indexed universal life policy compared to a fixed universal life policy.</p>

			<p>There is, at the same time, an upper limit on how much interest your account can earn. Similarly, there is a lower limit, which is the minimum rate of interest your cash value account is guaranteed to earn, no matter how badly the index performs.</p>

			<p>This is the reason why many people prefer an indexed life policy over a fixed life policy. It not only offers you a chance to earn more money, but also ensures that your policy accumulates cash value at a guaranteed rate, regardless of how the market performs.</p>

			<h4>Variable Universal Life Policy</h4>

			<p>In this policy, the cash value account is tied to a wide range of investment options. The money you contribute to your policy is invested directly in the market, so the rate of return is variable.</p>

			<p>Under favorable market conditions, your investments tend to fetch high returns. Under unfavorable conditions, they tend to lose value.</p>

			<p>This is the most flexible universal life policy offered by Minnesota Life. Apart from the flexibility it offers in terms of premium payments and coverage amount, it also allows you to choose your own investment options.</p>

			<p>The company offers a wide range of options for you to invest your money in. You can choose the appropriate asset classes to invest in depending on your risk tolerance and the rate of return you expect to earn from your investments.</p>

			<p>Unlike an indexed universal life policy, a variable universal life policy does not have any cap on the amount of interest that can be credited to your account.</p>

			<p>So, if the market is on an upward trajectory, you can expect significant returns on your investment. The flipside, however, is also true. If the market tanks, your investment portfolio is likely to lose value to a considerable extent.</p>

			<p>You can, however, mitigate the risks involved by diversifying your investments. Rather than excessively focusing on a particular asset class, you can invest your money in a number of high-risk, low-risk, and fixed return options.</p>

			<p>In this case, even if some of your investments go down in value, the earnings from other investments can offset your loss and avoid the possibility of getting negative returns on your investment.</p>

			<h4>Survivorship Universal Life Insurance</h4>

			<p>In addition to traditional universal life policies, Minnesota Life also offers a survivorship policy which allows two individuals to be covered under a single plan.</p>

			<p>It is easier to qualify for than an individual life policy and ideal for couples who want to leave a significant sum of money for their children. The insurer pays out the death benefit after both the policyholders have passed away.</p>

			<h2>Pros and Cons of Minnesota Life</h2>

			<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

			<h4>Financial Stability </h4>

			<p>The company is financially very stable, has an ‘A’ rating from all the agencies, has a nationwide presence, and is backed with solid assets.</p>

			<strong>Nice Range of Products</strong>

			<p>It offers a nice range of term and permanent life insurance plans. The company’s universal life plans, in particular, are excellent.</p>

			<p>Lenient Underwriting for People with Borderline High Blood Pressure and Cholesterol</p>

			<p>The company is quite lenient when it comes to people with borderline high cholesterol and high blood pressure levels.</p>

			<p>If your blood pressure level is 145/90, you can qualify for the ‘Preferred’ risk class, even if you are taking medications. This is not possible with most other insurers, since you are likely to be classified as a potentially high-risk applicant if you are getting treated for high blood pressure.</p>

			<p>Similarly, if your total cholesterol level is 240 or less, you can qualify for the ‘Preferred Select’ risk class, which is the best possible rate class you can qualify for. This is even more significant, as not many insurers allow you to qualify for the lowest possible risk class with borderline high cholesterol levels.</p>

			<p>If your total cholesterol level is 260 or less, you can still qualify for the ‘Preferred’ risk class, which is the second best rate class you can qualify for.</p>

			<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

			<p><strong>Minnesota Life is quite strict when it comes to smokers</strong>. While it is not exactly a downside and you cannot hold it against the company, it is something you should be aware of if you are thinking of applying for a policy with the company.</p>

			<p>The company’s best possible rate class – Preferred Select – is usually reserved for non-smokers. If you are someone who has quit the habit, you can qualify for the rate class only if you have not smoked a cigarette or consumed tobacco in any form for at least three years.</p>

			<p>If you have quit the habit and have not smoked or consumed tobacco in any form for one year, you can qualify for the second best rate class – preferred.</p>

			<p>If you are a casual smoker, you are likely to be placed in the ‘Standard Tobacco’ category, which means you are likely to be charged a higher rate.</p>

			<h2>Final Thoughts on Minnesota Life Insurance Company</h2>

			<p>If you have borderline high cholesterol or high blood pressure, Minnesota Life is one of the best choices for you, since the company allows you to qualify for its ‘Preferred Select’ or ‘Preferred’ risk classes.</p>

			<p>If you are a casual smoker or someone who has only recently quit the habit, you should look for <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/smokers/">companies whose underwriting guidelines are lenient towards smokers</a>. </p>
