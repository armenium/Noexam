			<p>If you are young and healthy, buying life insurance is a walk in the park. You are seen as a low-risk consumer by <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/">life insurance companies</a> and get the <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/rates/">best possible rates</a>.</p>
			<p>If you are a senior, on the other hand, buying life insurance might prove to be a slightly difficult task. You are seen as a high-risk consumer by insurance companies due to your age and any health problems that you might already have or might develop in the future.</p>
			<p>It does not, however, mean that life insurance companies do not cater to the needs of senior citizens at all.</p>
			<p>Almost all the insurance providers issue policies for elderly people and some companies even cater specifically to the needs of those who are on the wrong side of 50.</p>
			<p>In this article, we discuss why it is important for you to compare different companies before buying a policy, how choosing an insurance provider is different for a senior compared to a younger person, the best policies for seniors, and the best life insurance companies for seniors.</p>
			<h2>Choosing an Insurer is Different for Seniors Compared to a Younger People</h2>
			<p>For a young person in their 20’s or 30’s, buying life insurance is a pretty straightforward process. They need to undergo a medical exam, get a clean bill of health, and choose a company that offers the amount of coverage they need at affordable rates.</p>
			<p><strong>For a senior citizen, however, the process is slightly more complicated.</strong></p>
			<p>First of all, you are not likely to qualify for some of the policies that are available for younger people. Many insurance companies have a cut-off age, beyond which they do not issue term policies. They only offer permanent life policies for people beyond the cut-off age and the premiums could be significantly higher.</p>
			<p>Many insurance companies have strict underwriting policies and require the applicants to undergo a medical exam. If you have any preexisting conditions or have a family history of hereditary diseases, the results of your medical exam could severely dent your insurability. If you are considered a high-risk consumer, the company is likely to charge you a lot more than what it charges a younger person.</p>
			<p>Some insurance companies primarily cater to a younger consumer base and reserve their best rates only for them. While they do issue policies for older people, the premiums are often exorbitantly high and very few people can afford to pay them. So, as a senior, you cannot afford to randomly pick and choose an insurance company. You need to look for a company that caters to the financial needs of older people and offers affordably priced policies.</p>
			<p>This is why you need to be very careful while buying life insurance as a senior citizen. Young people can afford to make mistakes because they have time on their side. If they end up buying the wrong policy accidentally, they can cancel it, apply for another policy, and get accepted without any issue.</p>
			<p>You, on the other hand, cannot afford to make such mistakes. If you choose the wrong policy or the wrong insurance provider, you cannot cancel it and expect to get qualified for another policy instantly. With every passing year, your insurability reduces significantly.</p>
			<p>So, you need to keep these factors in mind while choosing an insurance provider.</p>
			<h2>Seniors Should Carefully Compare Various Life Insurance Companies</h2>
			<p>It is no secret that insurance companies charge senior citizens more compared to what they charge young people. Still, the rates differ from one company to another due to various factors.</p>
			<p>Some companies have lenient underwriting policies and accept you even if you have health problems like high cholesterol levels, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Some others, on the contrary, have very strict underwriting policies and reject people who are old and have preexisting conditions.</p>
			<p>Some companies accept older people as long as they do not have any major health issues and even offer them favorable rates.</p>
			<p>Some companies accept older people with preexisting conditions, but tend to charge exorbitant rates.</p>
			<p>Some companies do not require older people to undergo a medical exam at all, but charge a higher rate compared to people who undergo a medical exam.</p>
			<p>Basically, your chances of getting accepted or declined depend on the insurance company’s policy regarding senior citizens. Similarly, the rate you will be charged also depends on the company’s underwriting guidelines.</p>
			<p>As you know, each insurance company has its own underwriting policy, which means you never know which company is likely to accept you and which one is likely to reject you, unless you get a quote from them. This is why it becomes so crucial for seniors to compare different companies before buying a life insurance policy.</p>
			<p>Most insurance companies these days offer personalized online quotes, based on which you can decide if a particular company is the right choice for you.</p>
			<p>You only have to fill out a form and the company will provide you with a customized quote based on your age and health status. You can get such quotes from several companies, compare them with each other, and then choose a company that meets your needs.</p>
			<h2>Medical Exam – A Factor to Consider</h2>
			<p>If you are a senior citizen who is in the market for life insurance, you need to decide if you are ready to undergo a medical exam or not.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you are healthy and do not have any major health problems, it actually might be a good idea for you to undergo a medical exam to qualify for life insurance. There are many companies that offer policies at very competitive rates for older people who do not have any health issues. So, you might be able to save a lot of money by undergoing a medical exam and qualifying for an affordably priced policy.</li>
				<li>If you, on the other hand, are suffering from health problems and/or have a family history of hereditary diseases, it is advisable for you to choose an insurance company which does not require you to undergo a medical exam. There are many companies that issue no-exam policies which you can qualify for without undergoing a medical examination.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It should be noted that even insurers that do not require you to undergo a medical exam can reject you at times, if you have severe health issues, chronic diseases, or a terminal illness. In such cases, it might be prudent for you to choose a company that offers guaranteed acceptance policies.</p>
			<p>There are absolutely no entry barriers for these policies. All you need to do is apply and you will get accepted.</p>
