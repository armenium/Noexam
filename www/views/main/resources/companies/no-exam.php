			<h2 id="what-is">What is No Medical Exam Life Insurance</h2>
			<p>
			<blockquote class="green">No Medical Exam Life Insurance is <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/">term life insurance</a> that does not require a physical medical exam. It offers life insurance coverage to people who are in overall good health. Shoppers of life insurance should understand the following key characteristics of no exam life insurance before going forward:</blockquote>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No medical exam policies are not the same as guaranteed acceptance policies</li>
				<li>The application takes as few as 20 to 25 minutes to complete and consists of health questions regarding medical history that will determine the applicant’s insurability</li>
				<li>Applicants do need to disclose any health issues</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
			<h2 id="how">How is it Possible to Not Take an Exam and Still Get Life Insurance?</h2>
			<p>
			<blockquote class="blue">Although a physical medical exam does not take place, the insurance provider uses external sources to gauge an idea of the applicant’s overall health. This takes place during the life insurance application process via the following sources:</blockquote>
			</p>

			<h3>MIB</h3>

			<p>The Medical Information Bureau (MIB), is a member-owned corporation that operates on a non-profit basis within the United States and Canada. They have been in business for over 100 years and help life insurance companies in the underwriting process to determine the applicant’s health-based risk.</p>

			<p>Basically, the MIB serves as a fact checker for life insurance companies when it comes to the medical information you submit on your application. It helps the insurance company verify who you are, know what your medical conditions are, and make sure you are telling the truth on your application.</p>

			<h3>Rx Report</h3>

			<p>The Rx report, or prescription report, is another third-party resource used by life insurance companies during the underwriting process. This report allows life insurance companies access to information such as prescription history, quantity given, date received, dosage, refills, diagnosis, and other details.</p>

			<h3>DMV</h3>

			<p>During the underwriting process, life insurance companies can access an applicant’s driving records through the DMV. This includes driving infractions such as tickets, DUIs, and other traffic offenses. It also includes an accident history log.</p>

						<div>
							<p>Prices for no exam life insurance policies can range from $10 per month upwards to $100 per month. The prices depend on term length, health, and coverage amount. Those in excellent health can skip the exam and pay the same rate as for a policy they could normally not get without an exam.</p>

							<p>The chart below compares the average monthly prices of typical no exam life insurance policies. It shows that regardless of age or gender, a no exam product can be as competitive and affordable as a traditionally underwritten product.</p>

					<strong>Traditional Term Life Insurance</strong>

					<p>Term insurance designed to cover specific periods of time remains the most competitive and affordable form of coverage. Young individuals who are in excellent health may purchase a no exam policy for immediate coverage but may want to apply for a traditional term policy as well. </p>

					<p>For young and healthy individuals, a traditionally underwritten policy is usually more affordable. The coverage options may even expand with larger terms and more available riders to tailor the policies to the unique needs of life policy shoppers. </p>

					<strong>Permanent Life Insurance</strong>

					<p>Unlike term insurance, permanent insurance is a life product with no expiration date. Policy holders are covered literally until the end of their life. Permanent policies provide a wide range of flexibility because they are not just a life policy, but an investment product as well.</p>

					<p>Within permanent insurance, a portion of the paid premiums accrues to create a bank of cash value. That bank of cash continues to grow during the insured’s lifetime and provides the policy holder with options term policies do not offer. When the accrual of cash value reaches a certain limit, the cash value of the policy can be used to pay the premiums on the policy for the remainder of the lifetime of the insured. </p>

					<p>Policy holders can also use the cash value to finance other expenses they may encounter during life. It is not uncommon for clients to borrow against the cash on their policy to fund college tuition, home purchases, or even business ventures. In a sense, the insured becomes his or her own banker, borrowing from their own store of cash and paying it back, while it continues to accrue value over time.</p>
					<p>The companies listed above may specialize in no exam policies, but they also have a full lineup of traditional policies as well. If you are looking for instant coverage, our agents can assist you with that, but you may also wish for help applying for a more traditional policy for a later date, as well.</p>

				<h3>How Do No Exam Life Insurance Premiums Work?</h3>
				<p>Depending on the type of no exam policy you choose (simplified or guaranteed issue, term or whole life), premiums may work in a few different ways.</p>
				<p>First, some no medical exam term life insurance policies allow the insured to <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/single-premium/">pay for the entire policy up front</a>. This is a good option for someone who has the money to do so and wants to save some money in the long run, as life insurance companies offer discounts for people who pay in one lump sum.</p>
				<p>You can also elect to pay your premiums annually instead of monthly on some policies, which saves you money as well. These savings vary by company but are usually worth looking into.</p>
				<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
				<h2 id="types">What Types of No Exam Life Insurance Are Available?</h2>
				<h3>Simplified Issue</h3>
				<p>Simplified issue life insurance policies do not require a medical exam, but they do require a medical questionnaire. The insurance company will use the questionnaire to determine eligibility before issuing a policy, and acceptability based on medical conditions will vary from company to company. This type of policy is more restrictive than other “no medical” policies because health will be used as an underwriting criterion.</p>
				<h3>Guaranteed Issue</h3>
				<p>Guaranteed issue life insurance policies do not require an exam, nor do they require the customer to complete a medical questionnaire. Because of the broad acceptability, guaranteed issue is the most expensive <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/types/">type of life insurance</a> in terms of cost per thousand dollars of coverage. Our life insurance agents can determine if this category best fits an individual’s situation, shopping a wide variety of companies for the best pricing on their behalf.</p>

				<h2>Is No Exam Life Insurance Term or Whole Life?</h2>
				<p>No Exam policies are available in both term and whole life options.</p>
				<p>Term life policies are a good option for an individual who needs more than $50,000 in coverage. Like all term policies, coverage is not permanent throughout a person’s lifespan, but only available for the term selected. Term is available in increments of 10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year periods.</p>
				<p>Whole life policies and permanent insurance policies cover an individual’s full life span. Coverage is available in smaller coverage amounts, usually maxing out between $25,000 to $250,000.</p>

				<h2 id="payouts">How Does the Death Benefit Work for No Exam Policies?</h2>
				<p>When looking for a no medical exam life insurance policy, you want to be sure you find one with the right type of death benefits in order to best protect your family financially in the event of your death. There are a few types of death benefit payouts when it comes to no medical exam life insurance, and as an applicant, it is important you understand the different options available to make sure you end up with the right coverage.</p>
				<strong>Level Benefit</strong>
				<p>Level death benefits are usually applied to simplified issue life no medical exam insurance policies. This type of death benefit pays out the full death benefit of the policy to the policy holder’s beneficiaries immediately after death (once settlements have been made).</p>
				<strong>Graded Benefit </strong>
				<p>Graded death benefits are usually applied to guaranteed issue no medical exam life insurance policies. This type of death benefit is not paid out in full until a certain time period has expired after the purchase of the policy. This is designed to help life insurance companies mitigate the higher risk posed to them by high-risk applicants because guaranteed issue policies accept anyone. </p>
				<p>While it is not the company’s intentions, no exam policies with graded benefits can harm unsuspecting policyholders. This time period of partial death benefits after the purchase of the policy typically lasts two to three years (depending on the company and policy). During this period of time, only a portion of the death benefit is paid out.</p>
				<strong>Modified Benefit </strong>
				<p>Modified benefit no medical exam life policies offer a middle ground between level and graded death benefits. In this type of policy, the same timeframe as graded benefits applies. However, in addition to partial death benefit payouts, part of or all of the premiums paid into the policy are paid out in the event of the insured’s death prior to the graded period being outlived. </p>

				<h2 id="exam">What Does a Life Insurance Exam Include?</h2>
				<p>A life insurance medical exam typically involves: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identity verification</li>
					<li>Medical questionnaire</li>
					<li>Lifestyle questionnaire</li>
					<li>Family history questionnaire</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Also included in the life insurance application process are background checks, driving record checks, and prescription history checks. Life insurance companies get this information form secure, third-party sources and do not use your information for any other purpose than validating your current state of health. The reason life insurance companies do these additional checks is to ensure you are who you say you are and to determine your overall risk, which ultimately determines your life insurance premium.</p>
				<p>Some traditional life insurance policies require both medical exams and these additional checks. These types of life insurance policies are called “fully underwritten” policies, which refers to the underwriting process, or the process of determining risk.</p>
