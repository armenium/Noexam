			<h1>Term Life Insurance Rates by Age</h1>
			<?=$this->render('/main/widgets/authors-small.php', ['updated' => 'October 14th, 2019']);?>

			<p>Finding life insurance rates online can be difficult. Here you will find sample life insurance rates sorted by age and gender. These rates are just a starting point, but it should give you an idea as to how much life insurance will cost for someone your age. For the most accurate rate, use the quote tool on this page.</p>

			<h2>Get Your Life Insurance Rates</h2>
			<p id="compare">The life insurance quote tool on noexam.com will generate <strong>term life insurance rates in any state</strong> to compare.</p>

			<p>Life insurance rates are estimations based on basic information provided by the life insurance shopper. They are not firm offers. To get the most accurate rate, users should click apply and complete a quote with a company directly.</p>

			<h2 id="what">Factors that Determine Life Insurance Rates</h2>

			<blockquote class="center green">Life insurance rates are calculated by factoring in an applicant’s age, gender, height, weight, and overall health.</blockquote>

			<p>The rate charts on this page represent the starting point, age, gender, height, and weight to determine the rate class. Rate classes are typically labeled as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preferred Plus</li>
				<li>Preferred</li>
				<li>Standard</li>
				<li>Rated</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After using the quote calculator listed above, when an acceptable quote is offered, users can click "apply" to begin their application. Once the application begins, the applicant will need to answer some health questions to determine health classification. These questions involve family history and any current or past medical conditions.</p>

			<p>Having a medical condition like high blood pressure can move you to the next health class. A family history of heart disease or cancer before the age of 60 can also affect an applicant’s class.</p>

			<h2 id="calculate">Term Life Insurance Calculator</h2>

			<blockquote class="center blue">Use the term coverage calculator to <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/how-much-coverage/">determine how much coverage to get</a>. A good rule of thumb is to have at least seven to 10 times the annual income of the household’s main financial provider in life insurance coverage.</blockquote>

			<p>The answer to the question of how much coverage varies and is based on many of factors. When determining the amount of coverage, consider the size of the applicant’s family, as well as their future needs, such as college tuition or wedding expenses. Also to be considered are any debts, <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/mortgage/">such as a mortgage</a>. Adding all these expenses up will give an idea of how much life insurance that family will need. </p>

			<h2 id="terms">Pick a Term Length</h2>

			<blockquote class="center green">The right term length is one that provides coverage while it is needed most. A 30-year term will provide the best value but may not be the right option, given the situation.</blockquote>

			<p>When choosing a term length, consider age and insurance needs. A 30-year policy term makes more sense if it is affordable. This is because the older an applicant gets, the more expensive a life insurance policy costs. A 30-year term policy at age 40 is cheaper than a 20-year term policy at age 50. Most importantly, the policy must meet the needs of the insured and be affordable.</p>

			<p>Whole life insurance, on the other hand, specifically its cash value component, is confusing to many people. It is also more expensive, which is why we almost always recommend term.</p>

			<h2 id="ratesbyage">Life Insurance Rates by Age</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#tablepress-6">Rates by Age 18-29</a></li>

			<h2 id="pricingstudy">Life Insurance Pricing Study</h2>
			<p>In a recent study, we analyzed over 100,000 life insurance quotes that were requested on our website. The results are significant, but not surprising. The longer you wait to buy life insurance, the more it will cost you in monthly premiums. But what is more surprising is that <strong>60% of shoppers are waiting to get life insurance until after the age of 45</strong>. This is the problem that we are working to solve. Helping to raise awareness on the importance of life insurance. If you have financial dependents, get life insurance. As you are about to find out, you get the most bang for your buck by buying it younger.</p>
			<p>As part of our research, we asked nearly 4,000 people to guess the price of life insurance. The results were surprising. Of the group, 94% of the answers came nowhere close to the actual price of life insurance. Our research shows that Americans have no idea how much term life insurance should cost. </p>

						<p>An important thing to note is that this is for monthly premium. The total cost of a life insurance policy bought at age 30 vs age 45 could end up being the same if you are in perfect health, because as you age, your needs decrease (both term length and coverage amount). You'll be paying a higher rate but for a lesser amount of time.</p>

						<p>The reason we show the prices in monthly premium is because most people do their budgets on a monthly basis. Cash in, cash out. If your income increases along this same curve you won't feel a squeeze. If it doesn't, you will certainly be feeling it when you go to buy life insurance later in life.</p>
