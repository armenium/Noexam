			<p>Life insurance rates are heavily influenced by age. The older you are, the higher the rate. If you are curious about how much life insurance will cost for someone your age, use the tool below to quickly show sample life insurance rates from seven companies.</p>

			<h2>Why Should You Listen to Us?</h2>

			<p>NoExam.com has been in business since 2013. As a small business, we have helped over 10,000 families purchase life insurance. <strong>We have <a href="https://www.shopperapproved.com/reviews/noexam.com">over 1,000 verified 3rd party reviews</a> and maintain a score of 4.8 out of 5.</strong></p>

			<p>Our philosophy is to go above and beyond without any expectation for something in return.</p> 


			<h2 id="what">How Are Life Insurance Rates Calculated?</h2>

			<blockquote class="center green">Rates are calculated by factoring in an applicant’s age, gender, height, weight, and overall health.</blockquote>

			<p>The rate charts on this page represent the starting point. Age, gender, height, and weight are used to determine the <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/rate-class/">rate class</a>. Rate classes are typically labeled as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Preferred Plus</li>
				<li>Preferred</li>
				<li>Standard</li>
				<li>Rated</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After using the quote calculator listed above, when an acceptable quote is offered, users can click "apply" to begin their application. Once the application begins, the applicant will need to answer some health questions to determine health classification. These questions involve family history and any current or past medical conditions.</p>

			<p>Having a medical condition like high blood pressure can move you to the next health class. A family history of heart disease or cancer before the age of 60 can also affect an applicant’s class.</p>

			<h2 id="calculate">Term Life Insurance Calculator</h2>

			<blockquote class="center blue">Use the term coverage calculator to <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/how-much-coverage/">determine how much coverage to get</a>. A good rule of thumb is to have at least seven to 10 times the annual income of the household’s main financial provider in life insurance coverage.</blockquote>

			<p>The answer to the question of how much coverage varies and is based on many factors. When determining the amount of coverage, consider the size of the applicant’s family, as well as their future needs, such as college tuition or wedding expenses. Also to be considered are any debts, <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/mortgage/">such as a mortgage</a>. Adding all these expenses up will give an idea of how much life insurance that family will need. It's not uncommon to need a <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/one-million/">$1,000,000 life insurance policy</a>. </p>

			<h2 id="terms">Choosing a Life Insurance Term Length</h2>

			<blockquote class="center green">The right term length is one that provides coverage while it is needed most. A 30-year term will provide the best value but may not be the right option, given the situation.</blockquote>

			<p>When choosing a term length, consider your age and insurance needs. A 30-year policy term makes more sense if it is affordable. This is because the older an applicant gets, the more expensive a life insurance policy is. A 30-year term policy at age 40 is cheaper than a 20-year term policy at age 50. Most importantly, the policy must meet the needs of the insured and be affordable.</p>

			<p>Whole life insurance, on the other hand, specifically its cash value component, is confusing to many people. It is also more expensive, which is why we almost always recommend term life insurance.</p>

			<p>Term insurance can cost as low as $10 per month or as high as $500+ per month depending on age, term length, coverage amount, and overall health. The charts below provide average rates for a 50-year old man in good health.</p>

			<p>It is important to note once you buy a term life policy, the rates do not increase over the term period of the policy.</p>

			<h2 id="pricingstudy">Life Insurance Pricing Study</h2>
			<p>In a recent study, we analyzed over 100,000 quotes that were requested on our website. The results are significant, but not surprising. The longer you wait to buy it, the more it will cost you in monthly premiums. But what is more surprising is that <strong>60% of shoppers are waiting to get life insurance until after the age of 45</strong>. This is the problem that we are working to solve. Helping to raise awareness on the importance of life insurance. If you have financial dependents, get some type of coverage in force. As you are about to find out, you get the most bang for your buck by buying it younger.</p>
			<p>As part of our research, we asked nearly 4,000 people to guess their price. The results were surprising. Of the group, 94% of the answers came nowhere close to the actual price of life insurance. Our research shows that Americans have no idea how much term life insurance should cost. </p>

						<p>An important thing to note is that this is for monthly premiums. The total cost of a life insurance policy bought at age 30 vs age 45 could end up being the same if you are in perfect health. This is because as you age your needs decrease (both term length and coverage amount). You'll be paying a higher rate but for a lesser amount of time.</p>

						<p>The reason we show the prices in monthly premiums is that most people do their budgets on a monthly basis. Cash in, cash out. If your income increases along this same curve you won't feel a squeeze. If it doesn't, you will certainly be feeling it when you go to buy coverage later in life.</p>
