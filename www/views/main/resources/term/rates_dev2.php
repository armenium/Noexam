			<h2>What is Term Life Insurance?</h2>

			<!-- #tablepress-104 from cache -->
			<p>Rates do not increase over the term period of the policy.</p>
			<p>* The above term rates are for a healthy 30 year old male. If you are older you can expect the rates to be higher. For a more accurate quote, <a href="https://phpstack-223893-690316.cloudwaysapps.com/apply-now/">click here</a>. The prices listed below are for term life insurance
				products.</p>
			<p>Research shows that Americans assume term life insurance costs about twice as much as it does. Actual rates for a healthy male looking for a 20 year term life policy are between $10 and $37 per month. See these average costs of life insurance for a 20 year term policy on a male age 30
				in good health.</p>
			<h2>How Life Insurance Rates Work</h2>
			<p><img style="float:right;" src="../../../img/agenda-analysis-business-990818-e1540406089414.jpg" alt="explaining life insurance rates" width="300" height="183"/>The rate charts below are the starting point. <strong>Age, gender, height and weight will determine your rate class.</strong>
				The rate classes are usually preferred plus, preferred, standard, and rated.</p>
			<p><strong>Once you decide you are ok with the quote, a good agent will ask some preliminary questions.</strong> These are to determine if you will stay in the initial health classification. These questions involve family history and any current or past health conditions.</p>
			<p>Having a health condition like high blood pressure can move you to the next health class. Family members that have a history of heart disease or cancer before the age of 60 can also have an effect.</p>
			<p><strong>These questions are important because they save time.</strong> If your initial quote was for $15 per month, but you get moved to another rate class you may not be ok with the new price. This results in a bad customer experience. Consumers refer to it as the bait and switch. By
				asking these questions, agents can avoid having to come back with a higher price.</p>
			<h2>How Much Coverage Do You Need?</h2>
			<p>The answer to this question varies based on a multitude of factors. <strong>Generally speaking, you want at least 7 to 10 times your annual income.</strong> You must consider the size of your family and their needs in the future as well. College tuition and weddings are two
				obligations that come to mind. You also have to consider any debts you carry, such as a mortgage.</p>
			<h2>What Term Length is Best?</h2>
			<p>I am going to assume that since you are looking for quotes that you are price shopping. For this reason, I will exclude whole life insurance. <strong>When choosing a term length you have to consider your age and your insurance needs in the future.</strong> It makes sense to go for a
				30 year term if you can afford it. This is because the older you are, the more expensive life insurance is. A 30 year term policy at age 40 is cheaper than a 20 year at age 50. Most importantly, the policy must meet your needs and be affordable.</p>
			<h2>How to Get a Term Life Insurance Quote</h2>
			<p>Your first step is to find a broker who can provide you with quotes from <strong>more than one company</strong>. As an online broker, we have software that will give you quotes from the <a href="https://phpstack-223893-690316.cloudwaysapps.com/life-insurance/companies/">top
					companies</a> to compare. Simply visit <a href="https://phpstack-223893-690316.cloudwaysapps.com/apply-now/">noexam.com/apply-now/</a> and complete the form.</p>
			<h2>How to Get the Best Life Insurance Rate</h2>
			<p><img style="float:right;" src="../../../img/accountant-accounting-bankbook-948887-e1540405982162.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181"/>Getting the best rate is something that takes work. <strong>You must get quotes from at least 10 life insurance companies.</strong> From there you can
				choose the lowest price and begin the application process. If you sail through underwriting and get the policy in force, pat yourself on the back. You now have the best term insurance rate possible.</p>
			<p>If the insurance company comes back with a higher price, <strong>do not feel like you have to accept it</strong>. You can apply with another company to see if you <strong>get a lower rate</strong>.</p>
			<h2>How Does This Work?</h2>
			<p>Every life insurance company is different. They each have their own way of determining risk and prices. While your quote might come back higher with one company, you may get a lower quote with another. This is why it&#8217;s important to work with an experienced broker. <strong>A good
					agent will know what companies can offer you the best rates based on your health profile.</strong></p>
			<h2>10 Year Term Life Insurance Rates</h2>
			<p>A 10-year term policy is usually the most affordable option for coverage. It will offer a level premium for 10 years. Once the initial 10 years is up the premium will rise annually if the policy is renewable.</p>
			<h2>15 Year Term Life Insurance Rates</h2>
			<p>A 15-year term policy is similar to the 10-year term in that it is usually one of the more affordable term lengths. It will provide coverage for 15 years at a level premium. Once the initial 15 years has passed, the premium will rise annually if the policy is renewable.</p>
			<h2>20 Year Term Life Insurance Rates</h2>
			<p>A 20-year term policy our most popular term length. It will provide coverage for 20 years at a level term premium. After the initial period of 20 years, the premiums will increase annually.</p>
			<h2>30 Year Term Life Insurance Rates</h2>
			<p>A 30-year term offers the longest term coverage. Like the above-mentioned term lengths the 30-year term will offer a level term premium for the first 30 years, and after this initial period of can renew annually up to age 95 depending on the policy.</p>
			<h2>UL Universal Life Insurance Quotes</h2>
			<p>Universal Life, or sometimes called lifetime coverage, is a policy that offers a level premium for life. A universal life policy will offer coverage to up to age 121. The death benefit is fixed.</p>
