			<p>The above charts show the average cost of life insurance as it increases from age 20 to age 70.</p>

			<?=$this->render('/main/widgets/statistic-prices.php', ['data_type' => 'overall', 'by' => 'generation', 'for' => ['GenZ', 'Millennials', 'GenerationX', 'BabyBoomers']]);?>

			<p>As you can see from the charts, <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term/rates/">life insurance rates</a> rise as you get older. The monthly rate is higher at age 50 than it is at age 30, but by how much?</p>

			<p>All prices on this page are for term life insurance. Whole life insurance prices are not included in this study as the rates are much higher, and it is a less common type of life insurance.</p>

			<h2>Average Cost of a 20-Year $500,000 Term Life Policy</h2>

			<p>The most common term life insurance policy requested is a 20 year term with a $500,000 death benefit. These prices are for a healthy non-smoker male. This <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/how-much-coverage/">common coverage amount</a> proves to be very affordable for

			<h2>What Determines the Cost of Life Insurance?</h2>

			<p>Life insurance companies classify applicants into different health ratings. Health ratings determine how much you pay for life insurance. You are assigned to a health rating based on the following factors.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Age</strong> - The older you are the more expensive it is.</li>
				<li><strong>Gender</strong> - Women have a longer life expectancy than men, therefore life insurance is more expensive for a man.</li>
				<li><strong>Height and Weight</strong> - Your BMI is an indicator of overall health. The higher your BMI, the more you will pay.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>During the underwriting process, you may be moved to a different health classification based on the following.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pre-existing health conditions</strong> (like high blood pressure or heart disease)</li>
				<li><strong>Prescription report</strong> - Certain medications are indicators for health conditions.</li>
				<li><strong>Driving record</strong> - Numerous tickets or something major like a DUI will cause you to pay higher premiums.</li>
				<li><strong>Family medical history</strong> - If your mother or father died young from a terminal illness such as cancer, it can cause you to have to pay more for life insurance.</li>
				<li><strong>Occupation</strong> - Certain occupations are more dangerous than others.</li>
				<li><strong>Hobbies</strong> - Hobbies like motorcycle racing, hang-gliding, scuba diving, and sky diving all lead to higher annual premiums for life insurance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are moved to a different (lower) health class, your monthly premium will be higher. This is how life insurance rates can become very expensive. Older applicants with health conditions have the highest prices. A good life insurance agent will do what is called field
				underwriting. This is when they know that certain health conditions will cause a health class change. A good agent will save you time by placing you in the correct rate class based on your specific health history.</p>

			<h2>Average Cost of Fully Underwritten vs Simplified Issue Life Insurance</h2>

			<p>More life insurance companies are allowing applicants to bypass the <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/health-exam/">life insruance exam</a> if they are in good health. This is often referred to as <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/companies/no-exam/">no exam
					life insurance</a>. But this can also refer to a type of term life insurance called simplified issue life insurance. This <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/types/">type of life insurance</a> does not require a health exam, but it does require a medical questionnaire
				as well as numerous health background checks.</p>

			<h2>Average Cost of Term Life Insurance With and Without an Exam</h2>

			<p>For this cost comparison we used Sagicor's express issue simplified issue product and compare the prices to North American's fully underwritten term life product.</p>

			<h2>The Actual Cost of Life Insurance </h2>

			<p>You may be in excellent health and find your actual life insurance premiums are <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/cheap/">cheaper than average</a>. Or, you could find you don't qualify for the best rates due to a medical condition or tobacco use. It all depends. It
				depends on <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/how-much-coverage/">how much life insurance you need to buy</a>. It depends on the term length. It depends on whether it is a <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance/term-vs-whole/">term or whole life insurance</a>
				policy. The actual cost of life insurance depends on your life insurance needs.</p>

			<h2>Finding the Cheapest Rate</h2>

			<p>Yes, a 10 year term policy with a low death benefit will be the cheapest policy, but does it cover your financial needs? We advise our customers to first determine their needs, then compare quotes. This is the way to find the best prices.</p>
